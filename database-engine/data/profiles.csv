This is work in progress and I have posted a very basic version Druta v 0.1 on Github. This version, being the first one, has very minimal features and is intended to begin experimentation. Over the next several weeks, we intend improving the quality as well as the feature set and make it usable for real applications.Druta allows the developers to write JavaScript/HTML5 programs using a synchronous syntax that is converted by the Druta compiler to an asynchronous code that is executed on our runtime. Please go through the README.txt in the project page for more details.'}, 'fname': u'Anantharaman', 'past': {1: 'Section Manager Compiler and Tools at HP', 2: 'Section Manager at Hewlett-Packard', 3: 'R&D Manager Compiler and Tools at Hewlett Packard India Software Oper at ions P Ltd', 4: 'Section Manager at Hewlett Packard India Software Oper at ions', 5: 'Project Manager at Wipro GE Medical Systems, Bangalore, India', 6: 'Project Manager at Wipro GE Medical Systems', 7: 'Project Manager at GE'}, 'education': {1: u'Indian Institute of Science'}}"
